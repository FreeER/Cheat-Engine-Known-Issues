@DB how come dbvm says 'dark64 loaded' but still crash when I actually put it to use. Is that the Intel stuff you were talking about?

best load dbvm as early as possible.  E.g before windows boots(edited)

Thanks db for me loving them ytp's
Yeah but how
Burn it to disc?
DB - Today at 7:02 PM
yes, the vmdisk.img can be converted to a bootable cd-rom or usb
but your system must have been setup as legacy mode, not uefi (not in the one with 6.7 at least)

next version dbvm will support uefi boot though
